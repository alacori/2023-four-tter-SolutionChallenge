## ✨ **Introduction**

As Korean society enters an ultra-aged society, the number of single-person elderly households is also increasing. According to Statistics Korea, the percentage of solitary elderly individuals experiencing depressive symptoms is about twice as high as elderly couples, at 30.2%, primarily due to social isolation and loneliness. However, our guardians often fail to inquire about the well-being of their elderly loved ones due to being busy. To address this issue, Folder has launched. <br><br>
"Folder" utilizes Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send timely meal and schedule reminders for the elderly. Additionally, using Google's TensorFlow emotion recognition model, it detects the elderly's positive and negative responses as voice, checks their schedule and medication taken, and allows guardians to monitor them. Through this, guardians can care the elderly for more effectively and efficiently.

"Folder" aims to address UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3. health and well-being, and 11. sustainable cities. The elderly can record their daily lives in Folder, and this record becomes a way for their loved ones to know their news without directly asking about it. 
<br><br>
"Folder" serves as a platform to enhance the bond between elderly and their guardians, facilitating a sense of social connectedness and stability for those who may be living alone elderly. Our overarching goal is to ensure that older adults feel a sense of belonging to a stable social community, promoting their overall well-being and quality of life
